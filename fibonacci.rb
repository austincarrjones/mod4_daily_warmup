# Write a program that:

#    * Generates the first 25 numbers in the [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
#    * Prints them out one-by-one as it generates them
#    * Outputs whether they are or are not prime numbers
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

#pseudo coding
#how long is the sequence - loop 25 times
#one you have numbers, you have a whole separate function to evaluate prime or not
#another separate function for putting them together and printing
#or could start with the prime. It's ok to go out of order
#working backward is ok
#Interviewer would want to see that you can break it down into different segments.
